# ImageBase


This is a twin package to [ImageCore] with functions that are used among many of the packages in JuliaImages.
The main purpose of this package is to reduce unnecessary compilation overhead from external dependencies.

This package reexports [ImageCore] so can be a direct replacement of it.

Check the [reference page](@ref function_reference) for more information.

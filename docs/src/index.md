# ImageBase


This is a twin package to [ImageCore](https://github.com/JuliaImages/ImageCore.jl) with functions that are used among many of the packages in JuliaImages.
The main purpose of this package is to reduce unnecessary compilation overhead from external dependencies.

This package reexports [ImageCore](https://github.com/JuliaImages/ImageCore.jl) so can be a direct replacement of it.

Check the [reference page](@ref function_reference) for more information.

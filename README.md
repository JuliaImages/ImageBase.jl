This is a twin package to [ImageCore] with functions that are used among many of the packages in JuliaImages.
The main purpose of this package is to reduce unnecessary compilation overhead from external dependencies.

This package reexports [ImageCore] so can be a direct replacement of it.

Check the [reference page](https://juliaimages.org/ImageCore.jl/stable/reference) for more information of the functions.
